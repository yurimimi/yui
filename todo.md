# general

- categorise utils
- select multiple utils to run
  - specify order of exectution
- better navigation

# git related stuff

- add git config file generator with presets and/or custom configuration
  - custom config managed by yui, somewhat `git config` does
  - but yui can keep a number of configs at the time, so you can ask it to generate the file for a particular repo (directory)
  - it has a nice CLI
  - it keeps all the presets in a config file that the user could upload somewhere like GitHub to share (locally kept at .config)
- could I finally implement the .gitignore file generator..?

# File manager

- Try to build something like ranger.
    - Or just integrate it.
