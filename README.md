Yum is a utility manager that provides the user with a CLI menu with various utilities,
from image editors to file management systems. You are very welcome to fork it and modify
so that it becomes your utility manager!

I use [this awesome survey lib](https://github.com/Exahilosys/survey) for this app.

# Todo
